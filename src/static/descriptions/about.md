I'm a San Francisco-based software developer with a strong engineering background. I'm also a homebrewer, bread baker, and board game enthusiast. Here you can learn about some of my coding projects and other hobbies. Use the D3.js force simulation node map to navigate around - it's fun to play with too; the nodes are draggable.

My [résumé](google.com) and contact information are also available for inquiring minds. Shoot me a message if you have any questions or are interested in collaboration. 

I'm currently open to new employment opportunities.
