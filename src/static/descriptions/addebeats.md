Addebeats is an audio sequencer and soundboard built using Ember and HTML5 Audio Objects. I built this for the Summer 2016 Hackathon at Addepar over the course of ~2 days (and it won a category!). I used Yeti microphone to record coworkers saying various Addepar-relevant phrases and words. I then slapped on some audio filters with Audacity to create a range of unique soundbytes. These soundbytes are made available in the audio sequencer along with a set of more standard bass and drum noises (hi-hat, kick drum, etc).

The sequencer lets you associate specific soundbytes to specific beats in an infinitely-looping 16-beat phrase using a grid-based button UI. I also included functionality for per-track volume control and global tempo. The tool makes it trivial to set-up an interesting back-beat and pepper in some of the fun custom-recorded soundclips.
