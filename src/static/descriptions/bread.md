I've always enjoyed baking, which is likely a result of having a star baker mom. Most recently, I've been focusing on elevating my bread game after baking my way through Ken Forkish's wonderful book [*Flour Salt Water Yeast*](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X).

Like homebrewing, I love the process of improving technique through iteration. Making good bread is really just a function of twisting certain knobs (time, temperature, weights, and hydration) in the right way. I also love the feeling of working with dough as it transforms from disparate elements into a cohesive, delicious loaf.

For the extra-curious, here's my bread journal where I track recipe timings, weights, and temperatures. Keeping records is the best way to improve at anything!
