The Bay Area is one of the best places for craft beer lovers. Cellarmaker, SARA, Alvarado Street, Fieldwork, Barebottle, and more... drinking all this great beer serves as inspiration for homebrewing endeavours! Brewing is best done with friends to share the product with (and to keep you grounded when something inevitably goes wrong on brew day) - I brew with my pals Patrick and Ben. In the last few years we've brewed 20+ batches ranging widely in style: hazy NE IPAs, a smoked lager, single-hop pale ales, a cold-brew infused Coffee Porter, and more.

We do all-grain brewing, which I prefer over extract brewing due to the granular level of control we have on the grain bill. Plus, it's hard to top the rich smell of mashing in. I'm excited to continue brewing new styles in the future and further refine our brew process.

If you're ever stressed out, don't forget the homebrew mantra from [_The Complete Joy of Homebrewing_](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Joy-Homebrewing-Third/dp/0060531053): "Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew!"

Cheers!
