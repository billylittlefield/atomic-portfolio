JogLog is a social fitness-tracking web app built using React, Flux architecture, and Ruby on Rails. The app lets you record daily cardio workouts, specifying type (Running, Biking, Skiing, etc), distance, duration, and any notes. Other features include: follower/followee system for workout feed, commenting on posts, interactive calendar, teams for tracking a specific sub-group, and leaderboards with customizable filters.

This was my capstone project from App Academy in 2015, and the first full-stack web app I built. While I certainly don't think it's the prettiest application, I'm definitely proud of some of more nuanced bits of polish that I was able to apply in just 2-3 weeks of building. Specifically, the customizable filters on the leaderboard tool and cumulative weekly totals in the calendar tool are two handy features that I wish existed in my current exercise-tracker (Strava)!
