 When I'm not building software, I have a few other passions that take me away from the keyboard...

 * **Homebrewing** - All grain homebrewing since 2016 - click "Beer" below for more details.

 * **Bread baking** - Continuing with the gluten theme, I've been honing my baking skills - click "Bread" below for more details.

 * **Musicals** - Not gluten related (and maybe not quite a hobby), but I'm a SHN season-pass holder and love going to see live theater. My favorite shows include Waitress, Dear Evan Hansen, and Hamilton. The best highlight so far was winning a contest and getting flown to NYC to see Mean Girls on Broadway (and on Mean Girl's Day to boot - October 3rd).

 * **Board Games** - If it wasn't clear from my coding project Morado, I'm a big-time board game enthusiast. Current go-tos include Terraforming Mars, Root, and Terra Mystica.
