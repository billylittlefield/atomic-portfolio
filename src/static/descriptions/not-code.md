 As much as I enjoy working on software side projects, I have a few other passions that take me away from the keyboard...

 * **Homebrewing** - I've been doing all-grain homebrewing since ~2016, which has been a blast (plus, the end result is beer!). Brewing is a pretty scientific process that aligns well with my engineering mindset. My favorite brew so far has been a German-style Rauchbier lager, notable for its smokey flavor imparted by the smoked malt in the grain bill.

 * **Bread baking** - For the last 6 months I've been diving into another grain-based hobby. I was inspired to bake more often by my mother, and the interest really took off after reading Ken Forkish's awesome book *Flour Water Salt Yeast*. I bake a couple of loaves per week - my goal is to never have to buy store-bought bread, because making your own really isn't that hard and it is so much tastier.

 * **Musicals** - Not gluten related (and not quite a hobby), but I've fallen in love with the musical theater world since moving to San Francisco and getting the SHN season pass. My favorite shows so far include Hamilton, Waitress, Dear Evan Hansen, and Mean Girls. I'm a total late-comer to the world of theater, but am soaking up as much as I can to make up for it!

 * **Board Games** - If it wasn't obvious from my coding projects, I'm a big-time board game enthusiast (and am fortunate enough to have a slew of like-minded friends). Our current go-tos are Terraforming Mars and Root, and I always have a few async games of Terra Mystica going online.
